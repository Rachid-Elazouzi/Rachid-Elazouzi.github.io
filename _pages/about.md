Short Bio
======
Rachid El-Azouzi is a professor at the University of Avignon in France, specializing in computer science and applied mathematics. With a Ph.D. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Mohamed V in Rabat, Morocco, obtained in 2000, his work focuses primarily on optimal control, game theory, and the economic aspects of computer and information networks. After completing his doctoral studies, El-Azouzi joined INRIA (the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation) as a postdoctoral fellow and later as an expert engineer. In September 2003, he began his academic career at the University of Avignon, where he was promoted to full professor in 2013. He also had the opportunity to serve as a visiting scholar at prestigious institutions, including the University of California at Berkeley (2012-2013) and Carnegie Mellon University (2023-2024). His research interests span a wide range of topics, such as networking games, biologically inspired networks, wireless communication, and complex systems. In recent years, his focus has shifted towards the algorithmic and theoretical foundations of distributed systems, with an emphasis on federated learning, blockchain, and machine learning. El-Azouzi's contributions to the field have earned him several accolades, including Best Paper Awards at Networking 2006, Globecom 2017, MSN 2007, Netgcoop 2016, and Unet 2017. He has also played a significant role in academic publishing, serving as an associate editor for IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking from 2016 to 2020, associate editor for IEEE TNSE from 2022 to 2023, and since 2024, area editor for IEEE TNSE. From 2016 to 2023, he was co-director of the Agorantic federation, a collaboration that unites 8 laboratories in France, fostering research and innovation in the field.
